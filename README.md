Why This Platform Exists
Finding the right support at the right time is one of the biggest challenges for Hemophilia patients. Timely access to Factor therapy can save lives. But patients often face delays due to lack of information.

❌ They don’t know which hospital has Factor VIII or IX
❌ They don’t know which city has active NGOs
❌ They cannot check if the required vials are available
❌ They feel alone during emergencies
We are here to change that. Introducing India’s first all-in-one Hemophilia Support Platform, designed to bring **Patients, NGOs, and Hospitals together** on one digital network.
